## Security Best Practices

### Settings

- `DEBUG` is set to `False` to prevent exposure of sensitive information in production.
- Browser security features are enabled with `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER`, `X_FRAME_OPTIONS`, and `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF`.
- Cookies are set to be sent over HTTPS only with `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE` and `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`.

### CSRF Protection

All forms include `{% csrf_token %}` to protect against CSRF attacks.

### SQL Injection Prevention

SQL queries are handled using Djangoâ€™s ORM, and user inputs are validated through Django forms.

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

A Content Security Policy is implemented using `django-csp` middleware to protect against XSS attacks.
